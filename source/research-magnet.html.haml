                  %p.magnet-item__text Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is frequently misdiagnosed for Alzheimer dementia (AD), especially in its earlier stages. We characterized color vision impairment (CVI) in patients with DLB versus patients with AD to determine its usefulness in improving accuracy of early diagnosis.
                #methods107372.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with AD, DLB, and patients with mild cognitive impairment suspected to be in the prodromal phase of DLB (pro-DLB) or prodromal phase of AD (pro-AD). All patients underwent an online 15-hue color vision arrangement test.
                #results107372.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text Fifty-two patients were included in this study with a median age of 77 years, of which 44% were female. No significant differences in gender, age, or Montreal Cognitive Assessment existed among patients with AD (n = 15), pro-AD (n = 5), pro-DLB (n = 8), and DLB (n = 24). Of the 52 patients, 4 (2 AD, 1 DLB, and 1 pro-AD) had CVI history from a young age and were excluded from final analyses. New-onset CVI prevalence differed significantly based on diagnosis: patients with pro-AD (20%), patients with AD (15%), patients with pro-DLB (38%), and patients with DLB (78%, P &lt; .001). In a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with CVI, "diagnosis type" as a binary variable (DLB or pro-DLB vs AD or pro-AD) was the only variable retained in the model (odds ratio = 9.8 [95% CI: 2.3-42.1], P &lt; .001).
                #conclusions107372.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text Color vision impairment in patients with DLB showed a prevalence similar to the core features of DLB (âˆ¼80%) and can be supportive to a diagnosis of DLB versus AD. Pending prospective confirmation of our findings, simple online color vision testing could be incorporated into multivariate diagnostic tools to possibly improve accuracy of early diagnosis of DLB.

                  %p.magnet-item__text The incidence of diabetes mellitus in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy is increasing. To evaluate the impact of diabetes mellitus on contractility, we examined the calcium-induced force in left and right atrial myofilaments of patients with and without diabetes.
                #methods107401.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text We included 149 patients (106 without diabetes, 43 with diabetes), scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting from August 2016 to June 2017. The left and right atria were excised and prepared for skinned fibre measurements (pCa-force curve). The unit for the force measurements is Millinewton (mN). Comprehensive demographic data as well as echocardiographic findings of the patients were collected.
                #results107401.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text We observed a significant decrease of left atrial force values in patients with diabetes, averaged over all calcium concentrations (patients with diabetes 0.50â€‰Â±â€‰0.19â€‰mN vs 0.68â€‰Â±â€‰0.23â€‰mN in patients without diabetes, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) as well as in right atrial fibres (patients with diabetes 0.35â€‰Â±â€‰0.17â€‰mN vs 0.47â€‰Â±â€‰0.21â€‰mN in patients without diabetes, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005). There was a significant influence of repeated measurements (of the calcium concentrations) on force in left atrial myofilaments (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). There was also a significant impact of diabetes on the force values of the different calcium concentrations in left atrial myofilaments (P 0.002). In right atrial myofilaments we also found a significant influence of repeated measurements (of the calcium concentrations) on force (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Additionally the impact of diabetes on the force values was significant (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005).

                  %p.magnet-item__text Socioeconomic deprivation is a potentially important factor influencing surgical outcomes. This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence for any association between socioeconomic group and mortality after colorectal surgery, and to report the definitions of deprivation used and the approaches taken to adjust for co-morbidity in this patient population.
                #methods107369.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched for studies up to November 2016 on adult patients undergoing major colorectal surgery, which reported on mortality according to socioeconomic group. Risk of bias and study quality were assessed by extracting data relating to study size, and variations in inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality was assessed using a modification of a previously described assessment tool.
                #results107369.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text The literature search identified 59 studies published between 1993 and 2016, reporting on 2â€‰698â€‰403 patients from eight countries. Overall findings showed evidence for higher mortality in more deprived socioeconomic groups, both in the perioperative period and in the longer term. Studies differed in how they defined socioeconomic groups, but the most common approach was to use one of a selection of multifactorial indices based on small geographical areas.

                  %p.magnet-item__text The literature search identified 59 studies published between 1993 and 2016, reporting on 2â€‰698â€‰403 patients from eight countries. Overall findings showed evidence for higher mortality in more deprived socioeconomic groups, both in the perioperative period and in the longer term. Studies differed in how they defined socioeconomic groups, but the most common approach was to use one of a selection of multifactorial indices based on small geographical areas. There was no consistent approach to adjusting for co-morbidity but, where this was considered, the Charlson Co-morbidity Index was most frequently used.

                  %p.magnet-item__text A prospective cohort of patients undergoing cosmetic surgery between 2008 and 2013 was identified from the CosmetAssureTM database. Smoking was evaluated as a risk factor for major complications requiring emergency room visit, hospital admission, or reoperation within 30 days after surgery. Multivariate regression analysis was performed controlling for the effects of age, gender, body mass index, type of surgical facility, type of procedure, and combined procedures.

In univariate analysis, surgical site infections (0.6% vs 0.5%, p=0.04) were significantly higher among smokers, but suspected venous thromboembolism (0.2% vs 0.1%, p=0.01) significantly higher among nonsmokers. Notably, smokers had a higher risk of major complications after body procedures (2.9% vs 1.0%, p=0.01), as well as thigh lifts (23.8% vs 3.6%, p&lt;0.01) and male breast surgery (3.7% vs 1.4%, p=0.03).

                  %p.magnet-item__text Previous work has demonstrated that anastomotic leak can be caused by collagenolytic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis via an effect on wound collagen. In humans, E. faecalis is the organism cultured most commonly from a leaking anastomosis, and is not routinely eliminated by standard oral or intravenous antibiotics. Novel strategies are needed to contain the virulence of this pathogen when present on anastomotic tissues.
                #methods107370.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text Polyphosphorylated polymer ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 was tested in mice for its ability to prevent anastomotic leak caused by collagenolytic E. faecalis. The study design included a distal colonic resection and anastomosis followed by introduction of E. faecalis to anastomotic tissues via enema. Mice were assigned randomly to receive either ABA-PEG20-Pi20 or its unphosphorylated precursor ABA-PEG20k in their drinking water. The development of anastomotic leak was determined after the animals had been killed.
                #results107370.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text Overnight incubation of two different E. faecalis collagenolytic strains with 2 mmol/l of ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 led to near complete inhibition of collagenase production (from 21 000 to 1000 and from 68 000 to 5000 units; P &lt; 0Â·001; 6 samples per group) without suppressing bacterial growth. In mice drinking 1 per cent ABA-PEG20k-Pi20, the phosphate concentration in the distal colonic mucosa increased twofold and leak rates decreased from eight of 15 to three of 15 animals (P &lt; 0Â·001). In mice drinking ABA-PEG20k-Pi20, the percentage of collagenolytic colonies among E. faecalis populations present at anastomotic tissue sites was decreased by 6-4800-fold (P = 0Â·008; 5 animals).
                #conclusions107370.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text These data indicate that oral intake of ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 may be an effective agent to contain the virulence of E. faecalis and may prevent anastomotic leak caused by this organism. Clinical relevance Progress in understanding the pathogenesis of anastomotic leak continues to point to intestinal bacteria as key causative agents. The presence of pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis that predominate on anastomotic tissues despite antibiotic use, coupled with their ability to produce collagenase, appears to alter the process of healing that leads to leakage. Further antibiotic administration may seem logical, but carries the unwanted risk of eliminating the normal microbiome, which functions competitively to exclude and suppress the virulence of pathogens such as E. faecalis. Therefore, non-antibiotic strategies that can suppress the production of collagenase by E. faecalis without affecting its growth, or potentially normal beneficial microbiota, may have unique advantages. The findings of this study demonstrate that drinking a phosphate-based polymer can achieve the goal of preventing anastomotic leak by suppressing collagenase production in E. faecalis without affecting its growth.

                  %p.magnet-item__text The type of conduit used for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction during the Ross procedure remains problematic because of the limited availability of pulmonary allografts and the unsatisfactory long-term results associated with the use of xenografts. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) conduits have been proposed as an alternative. This study evaluated the results of RVOT reconstruction using a PTFE conduit during the Ross procedure.
                #methods107400.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text Between 2007 and 2015, 28 patients underwent RVOT reconstruction using PTFE conduits. The mean age of the patients was 35.9â€‰Â±â€‰18.1 (range 4-58) years. The total root replacement technique was used in all patients. The mean PTFE conduit size was 25.3â€‰Â±â€‰2.3â€‰mm.
                #results107400.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text The early mortality rate was 3.6% (1 patient). The mean follow-up duration was 48.5â€‰Â±â€‰31.2â€‰months; there were no late deaths. The transprosthetic gradients increased significantly over time. The conduit size was the only independent predictor of peak RVOT gradient progression (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). None of the patients demonstrated significant RVOT regurgitation. One patient required an RVOT reoperation.

                  %p.magnet-item__text The type of conduit used for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction during the Ross procedure remains problematic because of the limited availability of pulmonary allografts and the unsatisfactory long-term results associated with the use of xenografts. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) conduits have been proposed as an alternative. This study evaluated the results of RVOT reconstruction using a PTFE conduit during the Ross procedure.

Survival in the conservative, surgical and endovascular group was 71.7%, 80.8% and 79.4% at 1â€‰year, 68.2%, 80.8% and 79.4% at 5â€‰years and 63.9%, 72.7% and 79.4% at 10â€‰years, respectively (log-rankâ€‰=â€‰0.218). The rate of aortic-related complications was 58.3% in the conservative cohort. Cox regression identified the following risk factors for aortic-related complications: aortic injuries grade &gt;I [odds ratio (OR), 3.05; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.021], Trauma Injury Severity Score &gt;50% (OR 1.21; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.042) and the decade of treatment (OR 0.49; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.011).

This study aims to investigate the caregivers' perspective about the QoL of people with young-onset Alzheimer disease (YOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). We also aim to investigate factors that might be associated to caregivers' perspective in YOAD and LOAD.
                #methods107373.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text We included 110 people with Alzheimer disease (PwAD; 53 YOAD) and their primary caregivers. The PwAD completed assessments about their QoL and cognition. The caregivers provided information about the PwAD (demographics, QoL, ability to perform activities of daily living, mood, and dementia severity) and had burden of care assessed.
                #results107373.tab-pane
                  %p.magnet-item__text We did not find a difference in caregivers' perspectives of PwAD QoL according to the age at onset. However, the linear regression analysis indicated that caregivers' burden ( P &lt; .01) and PwAD depressive symptoms ( P &lt; .05) were significantly related to the caregivers' perspective of YOAD QoL. Caregivers' burden ( P &lt; .01), years of education ( P &lt; .05), and self-reported QoL ( P &lt; .01) were significantly related to the caregivers' perspective of LOAD QoL.
